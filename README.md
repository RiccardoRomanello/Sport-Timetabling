# Sport-Timetabling
This repository contains the project I developed for my Advanced Scheduling Systems Course during my Master's.
We were asked to choose an NP-hard problem and tackle it by means of heuristics methods. 
I adopted the EasyLocal++ Framework which helps in defining Local Search strategies. 
Once: moves, rewards, solutions updates have been implemented, the framework allows for different searching techniques like  Ant Colony and Simulated Annealing. 

The problem I tackled is sport timetabling
